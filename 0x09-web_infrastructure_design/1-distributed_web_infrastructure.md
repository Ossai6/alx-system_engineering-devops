For every additional element, why are you adding it: 
- Load Balancer:
Distributes the traffic between the two servers so that neither is overloaded.  
It also ensures availability in case one server is offline.
Masks the actual IP address of the servers, providing a form of security.

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works: 
- Random: This load balancing method randomly distributes load across te available servers.

Is your load balancer enabling an Active-Passive or Active-Active setup, explain the difference between both: The load balancer is enabling an Active-Passive setup. In Active-Passive setup, one server actively handles incoming requests, while the uthe remains on standby, ready to take over if the active node fails. While in Active-Active setup, the two servers are in use simultaneously.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master=Slave) cluster works: The function of the Primary node is to recieve data from the load balancer and permits read and write of the data. While the Replica only reads the data gotten from the Primary node.

What is the difference between the Primary node and Replica node in regard to the application: The Primary node read and write the data. While the Replica node only reads the data.

Where are SPOF: SPOF can be found in the load balancer

Security Issues (no firewall, no HTTPS): There is no firewall on the load balancer and servers

No monitoring: There is no monitoring.
